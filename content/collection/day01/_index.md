I am the third-year Ph.D. student of Research Evaluation and Methodology at the University of Florida. My research interests include enhancing item response theory in educational testing, applying machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to psychometric research. In my recent research, I concentrate on test engagement and measurement invariance. I currently serve as a volunteer in the team of Dr. Jinnie Shin and a graduate assistant in education psychology.
