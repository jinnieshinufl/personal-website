excerpt: In educational and psychological testing, lengthy instruments with many items may not be desirable as completing such instruments is time-consuming and cognitively demanding for test takers. Furthermore, in long self-report measures, participants may be unwilling to answer the items or show careless and insufficient effort responding. To avoid these issues, researchers have proposed various scale abbreviation methods that build short forms of long instruments (mostly psychological scales) by retaining the best items representing the target construct. Some of these methods include stepwise confirmatory factor analytical approach, Ant Colony Optimization, and Genetic Algorithm.
